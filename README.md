# Diamonds Price Prediction - Kaggle Competition 2020

This repository contains the code required to participate in the Diamond's price prediction competition on (Kaggle)[https://www.kaggle.com/c/dataptmad0420/overview]. The competition is the final test for Ironhack's PT 2020 Madrid Module 3, studying and practicing Machine Learning.


## Competition description

The goal of this competition is the prediction of the price of diamonds based on their characteristics (weight, color, quality of cut, etc.). This is an academic competition created for the students of Iron Hack Data Analytics Bootcamp Part Time Edition April 2020.

## Proceedings and resources

Every submitted result was obtained following the regular Machine Learning workflow. Data cleaning and calculations, ETL, Sampling, Training and Validation was done in Python 3.7 with standar libraries as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn and matplotlib.

## Results

The evaluation metric chosen for this competition is the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error). What is shown on the public leaderboard is the best score from as many as possible iterations after understanding and adjusting Diamonds train dataset and the ML model. Final result in the competition is based on a private dataset not available to competitors for training or testing.
